Features
========

We've finally come out ``Beta`` with these features. They are now
packaged directly in with our new :doc:`/products`. You can upgrade
to a product via `your dashboard <https://app.embed.ly>`_.

Overview
--------
Our new features are ready and added to our new products.

XSS Protection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  XSS protection support has been added to our new
  products, :doc:`Extract </extract/index>` and :doc:`Embed </embed/index>`.


Image Proxy
^^^^^^^^^^^

  If you have been enjoying the Image Proxy, you can now upgrade
  to our :doc:`Display </display/index>` product to handle images
  of all shapes and sizes. ``Display`` has an Image Proxy that allows you
  to crop and resize images on the fly to get the look and performance
  you desire. :doc:`Learn more </display/index>`


Screenshots
^^^^^^^^^^^

  Sometimes the image pulled from a page just isn't good enough, so you may
  want to show a screenshot of the rendered page instead. In the case of
  search, you may want to show the user what the page looks like before they
  visit it. Embedly allows you to add a screenshot of any url to your response.

SSL

  SSL support can now be used with all our new
  :doc:`/products`.


Article Extaction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Our brand new ``Extract`` product will provide an API to parse article
  text, entities/topics, ranked keywords, and much more.
