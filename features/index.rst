Features
========

Features are add-on's to Embedly's existing functionality. There are all
currently in Beta and require the Embedly team to turn on the functionality.
You can read more about our Beta Program :ref:`here <beta>`.

Overview
--------
Here is a brief overview of the current features in Beta.

:doc:`XSS Protection <frame>`

  Embeds are notoriously insecure in that you are allowing another developer
  to put content on your site. If that site is hacked or has a venerability, it
  can effect your site as well. In order to get around this, the best way is to
  serve all Embedly within an off domain iframe. :doc:`Learn more <frame>`


:doc:`Image Proxy <image/index>`

  Images can come in all shapes and sizes. While bigger images are great, if you
  are using them for a thumbnail it can drastically increase page load time by
  downloading large images. For layout purposes you also may want to crop
  images so they fit into fixed width and height area. Embedly has an Image
  Proxy that allows you to crop and resize images on the fly to get the look
  and performance you desire. :doc:`Learn more <image/index>`


:doc:`Screenshots <screenshots>`

  Sometimes the image pulled from a page just isn't good enough, so you may
  want to show a screenshot instead. In the case of search, you may want to
  show the user what the page looks like before they visit it. Embedly allows
  you to add a screenshot of any url to your response.

:doc:`SSL <ssl>`

  HTTPS are becoming more an more prevalent as privacy and security concerns
  increase. Very few sites however serve images or embeds over SSL. Embedly has
  built a solution that serves embeds and images over HTTPS.

:doc:`Article Extraction <article>`

  Reading on the web has changed drastically over the past few years.
  Readability, Pocket and Instapaper allow users to take an article and read it
  later in a nice clean interface without the cruft of site markup or ads.
  Embedly allows developers to grab the title, date, author and content of the
  article out of a page and create a clean interface for reading.

.. _beta:

Beta
----
Beta features generally came out of need by a large number of developers asking
for the same thing. We generally release them early and often to get feedback.
There are a few things that we would like to add as a word of caution.

Bugs

  There will be some, it's just in the nature of beta features. We ask that you
  report everything to `support@embed.ly <mailto:support@embed.ly>`_.

Pricing

  We generally haven't figure this out yet. It's hard to know what something
  costs us before we see what traffic patterns look like in the wild. When they
  graduate to first class features, we will notify users of the pricing
  structure.

If you would like to try any of these features they need to be manually turned
on by one of our support staff. You can send a brief email to `support@embed.ly
<mailto:support@embed.ly>`_ with your username and the feature you would like
added.

We also require that you are on some sort of paid plan as these features will
not be added to the free tier.
