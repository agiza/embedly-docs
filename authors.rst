===================

.. raw:: html

    <p class="preface">This page is a summary of the tools Embedly
    provides for bloggers and other authors who want to use Embedly without
    writing code. Developers who want finer-grained access to the Embedly API

Ever shared a link on Facebook or Google+? You might enter this:

    check this out: http://vimeo.com/18150336

But your friends won't just see a link. They'll also see something like this:

.. raw:: html

    <div class='example-frame' style='width:500px;'>
    <iframe src='http://player.vimeo.com/video/18150336' width='500' height='281' frameborder='0' webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p style='width:500px; margin:0.5em 0; font-size:0.9em; text-align:justify; line-height:1.1; color:#333'>The Need 4 Speed: The Art of Flight A collection of shots from flights made during the 2009-2010 season by the talented group of wingsuit basejumpers, while flying the V3, Hybrid LD2/Trango rigs and testing several new V-series wingsuit prototypes around Europe. Feel the need. The need for speed!</p>
    </div>

That rich HTML preview is called an **embed.** Embeds can contain any combination of text, images, audio, and video.

Embedly makes it easy to add embeds to your blog posts and web pages, giving
your readers a more engaging experience.

Blog/CMS Plugins
----------------

If you're using certain content platforms, you can install a plugin to
automatically generate embeds in your posts:

* `Embedly Wordpress <http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/embedly/>`_
* `Drupal oEmbed <http://drupal.org/project/oembed>`_

For information on the capabilities of these plugins, see the
:doc:`tools </libraries/tools>` page.
