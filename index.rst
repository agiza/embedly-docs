=============
Embedly is an API for turning links into embeddable content. For example:

* Give us the link to an image on Flickr, and we'll give you a thumbnail
  version of that image scaled any way you like.

* Give us the link to a YouTube video, and we'll give you the markup to
  display that video on your page or :doc:`mobile app <endpoints/mobile>`.

* Give us the link to a tweet, and we'll give you everything you need to show
  it properly: the tweet itself, a timestamp, and a thumbnail image of the
  author.

Plus, if you use our :doc:`Objectify <endpoints/2/objectify>` endpoint, we'll
give you additional metadata for that link: What are some keywords that
describe that image? What's the average rating on that video? How many times
has that tweet been retweeted?

To see Embedly in action, plug a link to any of our |num_providers| `providers
</providers>`_ into our `Explore
</docs/explore/>`_ page. When you're ready to integrate Embedly
into your own app, `sign up for an account </pricing>`_ and head to
:doc:`Getting Started <tutorials/start>`.
