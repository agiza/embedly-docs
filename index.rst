Documentation
=============
Embedly is the best way to retrieve meta data associated with a URL. We offer
a full suite of tools that you can tailor to your needs to make embedding
simple and easy. These docs will help you understand how to get the most out of
Embedly and how the API works. If you are new to Embedly we suggest reading the
:doc:`Getting Stared <tutorials/start>` tutorial. It will give you a basic idea
of how Embedly works and its benefits. 

Embedly provides a few different service levels depending on your usage. While
the basic usage level is free, we do have a monthly limit in place. Please 
check out our `pricing </pricing>`_ page to learn more about our service levels.
