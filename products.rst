Products
========
The Embedly Platform has 3 different products built to handle
frontend and user experience use cases. We will try 
to outline the different Products here and let you
explore on your own.

Embed
-----
This is our simplest product that lets you take URLs and display them inline.
If you run a blog or site that would like to automatically convert URLs to
media, this is for you.

Embed uses the :doc:`oEmbed <embed/api/endpoints/1/oembed>` standard to
pass back information about a URL. To get started, you can get a
more detailed overview of the features, or checkout the tutorials
for whatever you're trying to build.

Read
----
Our Read product allows you to extract all the important information
from Articles, Blogs, and Stories this includes full article text,
entities/topics, keywords, related content, and all the metadata
you will need.

To get started, try out a few links in our `Explorer </docs/explore/article>`_
or jump straight into the :doc:`Read API documentation <read/api/index>`.

Display
-------
Display is made for dealing with any image on the web. With this product
you can resize, crop, fill, and even securely proxy images on your site.

To get started, check out the :doc:`Display API  <display/api/index>`.
