Add-Ons
=======

Add-Ons exist for all Products and help provide you with functionality
that help improve security, performance, and overall design in your
application. You can add any or all of the Add-ons by updating your 
`Account <http://app.embed.ly>`_.

Overview
--------
Here is a brief overview of the current Add-Ons:

:doc:`XSS Protection <frame>`

  Embeds are notoriously insecure in that you are allowing another developer
  to put content on your site. If that site is hacked or has a vulnerability,
  it can affect your site as well. The best way to avoid this is to serve the
  embedded content from a trusted domain. With XSS Protection, Embedly will
  host an iframe of the embed on our own servers. :doc:`Learn more <frame>`


:doc:`Image Proxy <image/index>`

  Images can come in all shapes and sizes. While bigger images are great, if
  you are using them as thumbnails, page load time can suffer drastically while
  waiting for large images to download. For layout purposes you also may want
  to crop images so they fit into an area of fixed width and height. Embedly
  has an Image Proxy that allows you to crop and resize images on the fly to
  get the look and performance you desire. :doc:`Learn more <image/index>`


:doc:`Screenshots <screenshots>`

  Sometimes the image pulled from a page just isn't good enough, so you may
  want to show a screenshot of the rendered page instead. In the case of
  search, you may want to show the user what the page looks like before they
  visit it. Embedly allows you to add a screenshot of any url to your response.

:doc:`SSL <ssl>`

  HTTPS connections are becoming more and more prevalent as privacy and
  security concerns increase. Very few sites, however, serve images or embeds
  over SSL. Embedly has built a solution to serve embedded content over a
  secure HTTPS connection. :doc:`Learn more <ssl>`
