Tools for Authors
=================

Here is a list of the current set of tools that easily integrate with Embedly:

* `Embedly Wordpress`_
  The Embedly plugin allows bloggers to embed videos, images, and rich media
  from |num_providers| sources with just the url. It uses the Embedly API to
  get the embed code and display it in a post. This plugin extends the Embedly
  framework in WordPress 3.1 and up. Embed any URL using the built-in TinyMCE 
  modal tool.

* `Drupal oEmbed`_
  This module will allow your Drupal site to embed content from
  oEmbed-providers, as well as for the site to become an oEmbed-provider itself,
  so that other oEmbed-enabled websites can easily embed your content. Since
  version 6.x-0.6 this module comes with an autoupdating support for embedding
  content with Embedly.
