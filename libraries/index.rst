Tools and Libraries
===================

Tools
-----
Here is a list of the current set of tools that easily integrate with Embedly:

* `Embedly Wordpress`_
  The Embedly plugin allows bloggers to embed videos, images and rich media
  from |num_providers| sources with just the URL. It uses the Embedly API to
  get the embed code and display it in a post. This Plugin extends the Embedly
  framework in WordPress 3.1 and up. Embed any URL using the built-in TinyMCE
  modal.

* `Drupal oEmbed`_
  This module will allow your Drupal site to embed content from
  oEmbed-providers, as well as for the site to become an oEmbed-provider itself,
  so that other oEmbed-enabled websites can easily embed your content. Since
  version 6.x-0.6 this module comes with an autoupdating support for embedding
  content with Embedly.

* `Joomla Verge Embedly`_
  Using the wonderful Embedly API you now have instant access to content from
  over 100 websites and counting. All you need to do is place the media url
  inside the [embedly][/embedly] tags and the plugin will do the rest for you.
  Using the growing API functionality you can control the default height and
  widthfor all transformed links, as well as designate class and type of the
  wrapping element. By using the regex generator you can also limit the type of
  links that are transformed.
