Overview
========
The Embedly Platform is the easiest way to increase user engagement through
rich embeds and link previews. We allow developers to make deep apps with
related articles, trending content and recommendations for individual users.
With our Add-Ons Embedly makes it easy to display content on any site.

We will try to outline the different parts of the Platform here and let you
explore on your own.

Products
--------
Embedly has three major products that are designed for different use cases on
the web.

Display
~~~~~~~
This is our simplest product that lets you take URLs and display them inline.
If you run a blog or site that would like to automatically convert URLs to
media, this is the plan for you.

Display uses the oEmbed standard to pass back information about a URL.
To get started, you can get a more detailed overview of the features,
or checkout the tutorials for whatever you're trying to build.

Share
~~~~~
Share allows developers a deeper integration into the Embedly stack.
We pass back more information via the Preview endpoint and have a
very powerful Content Analytics feature that allows you to understand
how your users are consuming content on your site.

To get started, view some of the tutorials on using the
Share plan or look through the documentation.

Discover
~~~~~~~~
Allows users to dive into the content on your site and beyond.
In this plan we allow developers to recommend articles to users
based on their browsing history.

To get started, try out a few links in our API Explorer or
run through some of the features list to get a handle on all
the information you have available.

Features
--------
Every product has their own set of features that come along for the ride.
It's an individual piece of functionality that has it's own place in the world.
For a full list of features, checkout our Feature Reference.


Add-Ons
-------
Add-Ons allow developers to enhance their Embedly experience via a set
of APIs that are separate from the core features. These include an Image API,
SSL and Screenshots. For a full list see our Add-Ons page.
