Overview
========
The Embedly Platform is the simplest way to create a better
user experience in your application or site.
We allow developers to embed media, display images,
and make deep apps with related articles, 
trending content and recommendations for individual users.

We will give a brief summary of the different Products, Tutorials,
Libraries and APIs that make up Embedly.

Products
--------
All of our Products start with a simple link whether it be to
a video, photo, article, blog post, or even a PDF document.
Each product has a set of unique features that allow it to 
handle many aspects of working with 3rd party media and displaying
it perfectly within your site or application.
